What is the actual mileage per gallon compared to the manufacturer's EPA MPG?
Am I getting the MPG that is being stated by the manufacturer?

Also, after driving say 200 miles on a full tank of gas, how many more miles will can I drive until the gas is out completely out?

Although this project started when first driving a 2005 Honda Civic, I continued with my habit of also taking the data for  a 2016 Toyota Camry. However, the Camry already displays mileage left before tank goes empty.

Interesting facts from a quick stat of the data

The highest price for gas was 3.76 and the lowest gas price going to the gas station is 2 dollars.  
The tank takes an average of 12 gallons of gas.  
It costs around $36 on average to fill up a gas tank.  
The MPG was most efficient at 39 MPG and 19 MPG at the other end.  
The tank is filled on average every 21 days with the max 81 days, because the car was not used while I was vacation.  
Zero days between fill-up is because of a road trip that required filling up the gas on the same day after a long day of driving.  
The has is filled when there is an average of 60 miles left on the tank.  

EPA MPG: 39

Actual MPG: 31

Equation for finding miles left in tank given miles driven

MileLeft = -0.72(milesDriven) + 338.19

Note: Every gas station visit is a fill-up for the 2016 Honda Camry Hybrid. A majority of the fill-ups are at a Costco gas station with probably around 10 fill-ups at other branded gas station.
